    "\n",
    "Benefit: Abstraction allows for encapsulation, where the internal details of a class (attributes and methods) are hidden from the outside world. This promotes information hiding and protects the integrity of the class.\n",
    "Result: Developers can interact with the class through a well-defined interface, reducing the chances of unintended misuse or modification.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Code Reusability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: Abstraction encourages the creation of reusable components (classes) with well-defined interfaces.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: Abstraction facilitates polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common interface.\n",
    "Result: This enables more flexible and generic code, as methods can be written to work with objects that adhere to a shared interface without knowing their specific types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Simplification of Complex Systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: Abstraction simplifies complex systems by modeling only the essential features and behaviors of real-world entities.\n",
    "Result: Irrelevant details are abstracted away, providing a high-level view that makes the codebase more understandable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Ease of Maintenance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: Abstraction helps in isolating changes to specific classes, reducing the impact of modifications on other parts of the codebase.\n",

    "Aggregation in composition refers to a relationship between two objects where one object contains another object, but the contained object can exist independently. It's a form of \"whole-part\" relationship, where the parts (contained objects) can have their own lifecycle and can be shared among multiple \"wholes\" (containing objects). In aggregation, the contained object is not exclusive to the containing object, and it can be part of multiple aggregates.\n",
